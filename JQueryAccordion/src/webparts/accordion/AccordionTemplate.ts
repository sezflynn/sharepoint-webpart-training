        <h3>Arthur Dent</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
            Arthur Dent is a nice man and one of the kindest people to Marvin. Even
            after the Earth was destroyed, he categorized things according to "the
            Earth, and everything else. The Earth having been destroyed...meant that
            this view of things was a bit lopsided, but Arthur tended to cling to that
            lopsidedness as being the last remaining contact with his home." He places
            Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matics in the "everything else" category.

        <h3>Ford Prefect</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
            Ford was repeatedly described as an eccentric individual, one who was
            adventurous, broad-minded and bordering on becoming an alcoholic. According
            to the book, the friends he had made on Earth saw him as "an eccentric, but
            a harmless one - an unruly boozer with some oddish habits". Occasionally,
            while on Earth, he would gatecrash university parties, get badly drunk and
            start making fun of any astrophysicists he could find until he got thrown out.
            At other times, he would become oddly distracted, staring at the sky as if
            hypnotised and would tell people that he was looking for flying saucers.

        <h3>Trillian</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
            Trillian is 'a rather nicely descended ape-person.' Highly intelligent, having a degree
            in maths and another in astrophysics, she often offered clever and insightful
            suggestions throughout the story. Even though she had only been in space for
            a few short years, and despite only being on the stolen starship for a short
            amount of time, she had already figured out several aspects of the Heart of Gold,
            such as reading the instruments, by the time Ford and Arthur arrived on board
            due to the Infinite Improbability Drive, which she also had a good understanding
            of, despite its complex nature.

        <h3>Marvin</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
            Marvin hates everyone and everything he comes into contact with, having no respect
            for anybody and will criticise and insult others at any opportunity, or otherwise rant
            and complain for hours on end about his own problems, such as the terrible pain he
            suffers in all the diodes down his left side. His contempt for everyone is often justified,
            as almost every person he comes across, even those who consider him a friend. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Being a robot, he still does what he's told (he won't enjoy it, nor will he let you forget
            it, but he'll do it anyway), though he'd much rather sulk in a corner by himself.
