## JQuery Accordion

A basic SPFX webpart created as I followed the Microsoft Docs 'Getting Started' tutorial: [Add jQueryUI Accordion](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/get-started/add-jqueryui-accordion-to-web-part)


## Run the code in SharePoint Webpart Workbench

1. Follow these directions from Microsoft to [set up your development environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-development-environment).
2. Clone the repo
3. Navigate to the jQueryAccordion directory
4. Run `gulp trust-dev-cert`
5. Run `gulp serve`
